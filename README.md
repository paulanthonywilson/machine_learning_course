# Machine learning scratchpad

I have started a ML course and I thought it might help reinforce things if I translated some of the Python into Elixir. The obvious route is LiveBook but then I realised that does not give much of a chance to TDD things. So this is to TDD functions that I might then copy and paste into LiveBook or may include as s dep.

Or I might abandon this and dive into Python. dunno.
